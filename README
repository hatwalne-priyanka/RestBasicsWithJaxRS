This is a simple Rest API for  Messenger app.
The motivation behind this project was to learn Jax-RS. 
Concept: User can post a message. a message can have multiple comments from different users.
Status: Messenger resource is complete. Profile and comment resource are partially implemented.

Note: Since the focus of the project was to learn JAX-RS and not core java concepts like
 error handling, JDBC database connections. A temp database is implemented as a MAP for 
quick development. I understand the potential risks as the data structure and recommend using JDBC
for the purpose. Please refer my jdbc_exaple repo for more on core java concepts.
